    <h1>How to make pizza</h1>
    <p> To make pizza, start by preparing the dough: mix flour, yeast, salt, and water, knead until smooth, then let it rise. 
        Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by simmering tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and herbs. 
        Roll out the dough, spread sauce, add cheese, and toppings like pepperoni, vegetables, or mushrooms. 
        Bake in a preheated oven until crust is golden and cheese is melted. 
        Customize toppings and seasonings to taste. 
        Serve hot and enjoy the crispy crust, gooey cheese, and flavorful toppings. 
        Pizza offers endless possibilities for creativity and satisfies cravings with its irresistible combination of textures and flavors.
